# mojohelpdesk-chrome-extension

This is an unoffical extension to bring mojohelpdesk functionallity into GMAIL. It's been completely redone in REACTJS in this version (which I just learned in the last week) and it needs some cleaning up. It is almost ready to be published to the chrome store in the next week or so.
